      <h2>My Initial Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is <mark>Francis Gian Sinahan</mark>. So why did I choose <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> as my course in college?</p>
      <p>Well, to be honest, at first I didn't really know what course to take. I considered <em>HM (Hotel Management)</em> since people said it was an easy course. At that time, my mindset was simply: <mark>“As long as I graduate and get a degree, that's okay."</mark></p>
      <p>But my mom and my family disagreed. They told me that <em>IT is a better choice</em> because of how important technology is today. They also mentioned that <mark>IT is in demand</mark> and usually pays more than minimum wage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
      <h2>The Bus Journey</h2>
      <p>Even after that, I was still undecided. I kept <em>praying to God</em>, asking Him to give me a sign whether IT was really for me or if there was another course that suited me better.</p>
      <p>I'm not sure about the exact date, but around July 21, I decided to withdraw from HM. My mom kept telling me to do it before it was too late, so I finally did.</p>
      <p>After that, I took a bus from the <em>South Bus Terminal</em>. While we were waiting for the bus to fill up, a man sat beside me. He greeted me, <q>Good evening</q>, and I replied, <q>Good evening too</q>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
      <h2>Why IT?</h2>
      <p>After a few minutes, as the bus started moving, he asked me why I was in Cebu at that time. I told him I had just withdrawn from my course, HM. He asked why, and I explained that my mom didn't like it and I didn't think it was the right fit for me either.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, he agreed with my mom. He said <mark>IT is really in demand nowadays</mark>. Back in his time, HM was the popular course, but times and technology change. He told me that when he was younger, he also didn't know what course to take. He chose Accountancy because he wanted to challenge himself.</p>
      <p>We talked more about his life, and after a while, he brought the conversation back to my decision. He said, <q>Maybe your mom is right. She wouldn't push you into a course if she didn't believe it was right for you.</q></p>
      <p>Before he got off the bus, he said something that stuck with me:<br><mark>"Good luck, dong. I know makaya ra na nimo."</mark></p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>I was amazed because he was just a stranger, yet he supported me like family. That was my story of why I chose IT. It wasn't a simple or clear path, but I believe I was guided to it for a reason.</p>
      <p>After that, I realized that choosing a course is not just about what is easy, it's about what can really help me in the future. <em>IT is not the easiest course</em>, but I know it has many opportunities.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I still feel nervous if I can really do it. But I always remind myself that <mark>no course is easy</mark>. Every course needs <em>hard work, time, and sacrifice</em>. What matters is how you stay focused and how you push yourself to reach your goals.</p>
      <p>For me, choosing IT is not just about getting a degree. It's also about <strong>building skills</strong> that I can use anywhere and anytime. Now, I feel more motivated to continue with IT and make my family proud.</p>
